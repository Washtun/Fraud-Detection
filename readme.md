## Fraud Detection

This notebook covers the techniques for dealing with fraud detection in financial transaction, along with an example dataset, visuals, and feature selection methods to train and models utilizing these techniques.

 The dataset for the project was downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1/download?datasetVersionNumber=2) using the `opendatasets` library. Downloading a dataset from kaggle with the `opendatasets` library requires you to create a personal `username` and `keys` on kaggle in form of a .json file, which will be requested everytime you want to download a dataset into your local directory with the `opendatasets` library.
 
 The dataset was downloaded in this way because the unique URL provided doesn't include a .csv path
